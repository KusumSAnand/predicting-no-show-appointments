The project analyses the dataset from the Brazil  Healthcare system to understand factors that influence the 'no-show' for the scheduled medical appointments. Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed to answer the following - 

-  Effect on show/no_show for appointments based on the difference in days between appointment scheduled date and appointment date.
- Influence of sms on show-up status.
- Are patients with poor health history prompt in their appointments.Does age play a role here?
- Promptness in attendence of a specific age group.
